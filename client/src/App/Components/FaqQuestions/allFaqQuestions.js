    question: 'What is teext.me for?',
    answer: 'Teext.me allows you to share a link on your public profiles so that people can send you messages. People who really want to contact you will have to pass a paywall. This will stop most spam from getting through. And if it happens, at least you earn bitcoin!'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'Where can I use it?',
    answer: 'In all public places where you normally put your email address. For example: linktree, instagram, your website, any social profile of yours where you would put an email.'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'How it works',
    answer: 'Its super simple. Create an account in less than 1 minute, set how much you want to charge per message (in satoshis) and specify where you want to receive the message (email address). That is all. Share your link and start receiving messages and satoshis.'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'What are satoshis/sats?',
    answer: 'Just like one Euro can be divided into 100 Euro Cents, one bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 smaller units. These smallest units of bitcoin are called satoshis, also known as sats. Because the rate of one bitcoin is high and will likely keep increasing, using sats makes smaller transactions easier. The unit was named in honor of the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.'

    question: 'Do I need a wallet before I can use teext.me?',

  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'What is Lightning Network?',
    answer: 'The Lightning Network is a secure second layer protocol built on the Bitcoin network that enables almost free and instant micropayments.'

    id: 8,
    question: 'Do I have to use the same registration email address to receive the messages?',
    answer: 'No. You can use any email to register and use another email to receive the messages. Of course, if you really want to receive messages you must put an email that you are going to read!'
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: 'Are the messages I receive saved?',
    answer: 'No. Teext.me does NOT store the messages that are sent, we simply act as a bridge or paywall between the messenger and the receiver. We store the minimum information necessary for the service to work and to be able to pay the corresponding satoshis.'
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer: 'Registration is completely free. And it always will be.'
  },

    id: 11,
    question: 'How does the platform make money?',
    answer: 'Transparency is one of our values. The platform earns 10% of the amount of the payments. If your message costs 3000 sats, we will charge 3300 sats to the user.'
