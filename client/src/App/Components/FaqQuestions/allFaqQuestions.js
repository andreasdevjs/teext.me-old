    question: 'What is teext.me for?',
    answer: 'Teext.me allows you to share a link on your public profiles so that people can send you messages. People who really want to contact you will have to pass a paywall. This will stop most spam from getting through.'

    question: 'How it works',
    answer: 'Its super simple. Create an account in less than 1 minute, set how much you want to charge per message (in satoshis) and specify where you want to receive the message (email address). That is all. Share your link and start receiving messages and satoshis.'

    question: 'What are satoshis/sats?',
    answer: 'Just like one Euro can be divided into 100 Euro Cents, one bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 smaller units. These smallest units of bitcoin are called satoshis, also known as sats. Because the rate of one bitcoin is high and will likely keep increasing, using sats makes smaller transactions easier. The unit was named in honor of the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.'

    question: 'What is Lightning Network?',

    id: 8,
    question: 'Do I have to use the same registration email address to receive the messages?',
    answer: 'No. You can use any email to register and use another email to receive the messages.'
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: 'Are the messages I receive saved?',
    answer: 'No. Teext.me does NOT store the messages that are sent, we simply act as a bridge or paywall between the messenger and the receiver. We store the minimum information necessary for the service to work and to be able to pay the corresponding satoshis.'
